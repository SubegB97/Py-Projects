Classic Pong!

Yes, this is the classic Atari game pong. This is a clone of the beloved flappy bird but written in python.

Some edits

The first thing is that this game can only be played on a single device. I do intend to add multiplayer down utilizing a client and server so players can play from different devices.

The left paddle player will use the "w" and "s" keys to move up and down. The right paddle player will use the up and down arrow keys. 

The score keeping mechanism is still a bit buggy but it works when the ball passes each players paddle. I am working on another solution to that problem.

A minor issue is that the paddle movement isn't the smoothest, I am working on adjusments to make that better for players.
